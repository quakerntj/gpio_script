gpio_script
===========

This is a script interpreter for controlling my Raspberry Pi GPIO.

I use the Bison and Flex for the command parsing.

Now it support basic control.  There are something still not implement.
Like listening to edge trigger, level trigger, function, load script, 
and error handling.

See README for the command description.
